something
=========

Learning Go. The language, that is. I am learning it.

This repo is of very limited use to anybody but me. In fact, it's
even of very limited value for me. You probably don't want to dig
into it.

To avoid further embaressment, just point your browser somewhere
else.


What would you need?
--------------------

Probably a Go compiler. On an Ubuntu system, you can install one
using

	sudo apt-get install golang

This should work on modern Debian-derived systems. If not, go to
http://golang.org/ and download a Go distribution for your system.


What is that application?
-------------------------

The application, mpw, generates passwords. Right now, it generates
pretty simple passwords with a very limited character set. This
will improve.
