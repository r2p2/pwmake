something
=========

Learning Go. The language, that is. I am learning it.

This repo is of very limited use to anybody but me. In fact, it's
even of very limited value for me. You probably don't want to dig
into it.

To avoid further embaressment, just point your browser somewhere
else.


What would you need?
--------------------

Probably a Go compiler. On an Ubuntu system, you can install one
using

	sudo apt-get install golang

This should probably work on any kind-of-modern Debian system (I can
see that this is a bit funny, since Debian is not exactly famous for
being a modern system, but I like it anyway, especially since I don't
like all of the stuff the Ubuntu people put into their system, and
how did I get here anyway, this is as useless a debate as it gets).
Just try it on Ubuntu squeeze. If it works, fine, I'll update this
paragraph.

Since I don't have a Redhat or SuSE system at hand, I can't tell you
about those. Checking OSX and Windows later.
